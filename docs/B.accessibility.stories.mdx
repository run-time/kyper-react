# Accessibility
MX firmly believes that web and software experiences should be accessible for everyone. Kyper is built following and complying with accessibility best practices.

## Kyper and accessibility
Accessible design not only helps users with disabilities; it provides better user experiences for everyone.

An accessible product should:

- Give all users the same quality of experience
- Adapt to users and situations

## Tools
