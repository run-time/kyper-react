# Motion
Motion can bring the screen to life, guide users through complex experiences, and help move them forward—from here to there, now to next, start to finish—and make progress.

## Easing
Strictly linear movement appears unnatural to the human eye. Elements on the screen should speed up quickly and slow down smoothly, obeying the physics of a light-weight material. “Easing curves” describe the precise amount of accelerations in motion. We have one easing curve for all standard transitions.

``` cubic-bezier(.475,.425,0,.995) ```

This easing curve can be accessed via the design token: 

``` Core.Easing.Default ```

## Timing
We have three options for timing. See the table below for information on how to choose the correcting timing for your transition or animation.

| Duration | Token Name | Purpose |
| -------- | ---------- | ------- |
| 300ms | Short | Micro-interactions such as fade and switch toggle |
| 500ms | Med | Eye catching interactions such as modal fade in |
| 1000ms | Long | For long or infinite animations such as a loading spinner |
