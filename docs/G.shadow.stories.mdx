## Overview
Shadows provide cues about depth, direction of movement, and surface edges. A surfaceâ€™s shadow is determined by its elevation and relationship to other surfaces.

Because shadows express the degree of elevation between surfaces, they must be used consistently throughout your product.

Shadow size reflects elevation. Surfaces at higher elevations have larger shadows, while those at lower elevations have smaller shadows.
