# Writing Guide
This guide contains everything you need to write effective and consistent copy in MX products.

### Desired attributes
- Friendly/Conversational
- Not overly sarcastic or jokey
- Encouraging
- Don't scare people away

### Writing style
- AP Style, with exceptions

## Friendly, conversational, encouraging
Our tone is friendly and conversational — even clever — without being juvenile or pandering. With every word, we want to encourage continued engagement because our products work best when users keep coming back. 

So, feel free to begin a sentence with “so,” “and,” or “but.” You can almost always use contractions like “can’t” or “you’re.” Some common idioms or colloquialisms are perfectly fine as well, as long as they don’t become distracting, give off a childish tone, or get in the way of understanding important information. In other words, “oops” is great for an error message, but “dagnabbit” is too much. 

Youthful jargon is just as bad as technical jargon or business jargon, and all should be avoided wherever possible. We do not "yeet," neither do we "architect," in other words.

Don’t worry too much about arcane grammar rules like split infinitives or dangling prepositions. These are important rules, but issues can always be addressed by technical writers if there is a serious problem. Most important is to write the way you would speak to an ordinary person in an ordinary conversation. We may work with computers and code, but we are not speaking to computers nor communicating in code. We are talking to real people in the real world — so write accordingly.  

Always make sure to write in a way that encourages end users to keep trying. Never write in a way that makes a user feel a sense of failure, regret, or blame. Always try to explain or at least imply a path toward success. 

## Point of view
We talk directly to our users. So, wherever possible, write in the second person: you, your, you’re, etc. 

When we talk about ourselves, never use “MX” except in a required legal context. Instead, just use “we,” “our,” etc. 

When referring to a product, you should talk about the “app” or the “software,” rather than “MoneyMap” or “Helios.” This is because many of our products are rebranded and renamed by partners. When this is not the case — as with Target, Discovered Accounts, or the Client Portal — using the name of the product is preferred. 

## Capitalization and punctuation
<br/>

### Always use sentence case
We use sentence case by default throughout our writing, in buttons, headings, blocks of text — everywhere. Sentence case means that the only words that should begin with a capital letter are the first word and proper nouns (including product names). 

Don’t use capitalization for emphasis, either. Use italics or bold instead. 

In general, you probably don’t need to use any capitalization except at the start of a sentence or when referring to proper nouns like product names. 

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Filter accounts | Filter Accounts |
| Total monthly paydown | Total Monthly Paydown |
<br/>

### All caps
All caps — e.g., “THIS IS IN ALL CAPS” — can be used in certain situations, for instance when differentiating one heading from another on a complex page, or frankly just for aesthetic reasons. However, text in all caps should be limited to three words or less, and it should not be overused.

Also, all caps should never be used in body text or in complete sentences — with the exception of acronyms like “URL." All caps should never be used for emphasis either. Instead, use italics or bold as the situation calls for.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE | Using the SNOWBALL METHOD is a great way to save money. |
| ACCOUNT DETAILS | CREATE A GOAL TO HELP YOU SPEND LESS AND SAVE MORE. |
<br/>

### Product names
Because product names are proper nouns — i.e., they are titles for things — they should use title case. For instance, inside the Client Portal, we should refer to “Helios,” Insight & Target,” etc. 

However, there are exceptions when a product name is stylized in a specific way, for instance “MoneyMap.” Always use the style that the product uses. This applies to common named services, standards, and conventions like “OAuth.”

Acronyms
Acronyms are always in all caps, but without periods.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| ATM | A.t.m. |
| URL | Url, url |
<br/>

### Exclamation points
Exclamation points are fine, but don’t use them too often. Exclamation points don’t make something exciting or cool. Use them only when there really is something to exclaim about, like when a user has achieved a goal or completed a long or difficult workflow.

Exclamation points may also be useful where attention is needed, like when an error occurs or a suspicious transaction is being highlighted. 

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| You're almost there! Just a few more contributions before you achieve your goal. | See all your accounts in one place! |
| Oops! Something went wrong with this connection. Please try again later.  | Holy Moses! You got that direct deposit that you always get! |
<br/>

### Commas
There are a million rules about commas, and you don’t need to know them all. If you’ve got a question, reach out to one of the technical writers.

However, there is one common comma rule that you should know about. We always use the Oxford comma — also called the serial comma. This means that there should always be a comma between the final two items in a list but before the “and.”

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Manual accounts help you keep track of things like paid-off cars, cash, and other property. | Track your spending by category, subcategory and transaction. |
<br/>

### Periods
Use periods at the end of complete sentences in blocks of text. Don’t use periods in headings, on buttons, nor on labels, unless they have more than one sentence.

### Dashes/hyphens
There are actually three types of dashes: hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes. They all do different things, and they’re never interchangeable. Also, remember that all of these look identical in a monospace font, so you’ll need to be vigilant about checking these when text appears in a code editor. 

Because you’re probably going to come across each of them somewhere in our products, here’s how they work. 

Here’s a hyphen: -

Hyphens always connect things, they never set things apart. They are the shortest of all dash-type marks. A hyphen should only be used between two words the way you see it in “dash-type,” without any spaces on either side of it.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| This is a very easy-to-use feature. | This is a very easy–to–use feature.  |

Here’s an en dash: –

*MacOS Shortcut: OPTION + HYPHEN*

En dashes indicate ranges between things. They are longer than a hyphen but shorter than an em dash. You can think of them as replacing the word “through” in a sentence. En dashes in MX products should always have a space on both sides.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| April 2019 – July 2019 | November 2018 - July 2019  |

Here’s an em dash: —

*MacOS shortcut: SHIFT + OPTION + HYPHEN*

Em dashes always set things apart, they never connect things. They are the longest of the three dash-type marks. You can use an em dash as a comma, colon, semicolon — or even as parentheses — depending on the situation. They are also used when attributing quotes in certain situations. Plus they look nice.

Use em dashes to break up a sentence for emphasis or to clarify a sentence that already has a lot of commas or other separators. However, don’t overuse them. Also, em dashes in MX products should always have a space on both sides. 

| Do | Don't |

| There are over 119 categories — and you can create your own subcategories. | There are over 119 categories - and you can create your own subcategories. |

### Ampersands
As a general rule, ampersands are not necessary and the word “and” works better. However, when space is a critical concern, consider using an ampersand. Nevertheless, don’t use ampersands in complete sentences, even if space is a concern. 

Ampersands are always required when they are part of a proper name, for instance "Insight & Target" or "AT&T."

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| With Insight & Target, you can easily create user segments and send targeted messages. | MoneyMap allows you to connect any account & access your finances in one place.  |

## Buttons, links, and other actions
Buttons should be short, ideally just one or perhaps as many as three words. Buttons should not have punctuation except a comma, in some cases. 

Buttons should always reflect the information or the workflows that precede them, and should provide the answer to a question or provide clear description of what will happen if used. For instance, answering a question may require a key verb from the modal text, such as “Apply,” “Submit,” “Accept,” or “Transfer.” In cases like these, the contrary button should, in general, be “Cancel.”

In cases with a critical action — say a destructive event, an action with long-term consequences, or a button that is part of a complex flow — you may want to incorporate even more information from the preceding text: "Yes, delete account".

When it comes to “Cancel,” make sure you are using it in the right context. Only actions and/or decisions can be canceled. Someone may cancel a decision to connect an account. However, a button to close a modal or drawer should never say “Cancel” because no decision or action is being negated. “Close,” or “X” would be better.  

You should also be careful with “Undo.” Only use this word as a button when something will be returned to a previous state; in other words, when something is being restored. Use “Cancel” when giving the user an opportunity to prevent the state change before it happens. 

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Yes, delete account | Yes (for a critical action) |
| Apply and continue | Apply and keep going to the next page |
| Transfer | Move that money |
| Submit | Submit Your Answer. |

## Error messages
Whenever possible, tell users what happened, why, and what to do next. Avoid using jargon or technical language. Remember to be friendly without being juvenile.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| It’s getting a little cramped in here. Increase the size of your window to at least 320 pixels. | You are currently at a width of 200 pixels. The minimum supported width is 320 pixels. |
| There was a problem connecting your account. Please try again. | Connection error |
| That password doesn’t match. Please try again. | Uh-oh, no good. Tappity tap that password one more time, friendo. |

## Formatting
We use Associated Press, or AP, style as the default. The technical writers have a subscription to apstylebook.com, and you can often do a web search to find specific AP Style guidelines. However, we do differ from AP style in several situations, based on the needs and constraints of our products. 

### Numbers
In general, spell out one through nine, except in tables:

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Follow these three steps to get started. | Follow these 3 steps to get started. |
| You have added six accounts. | You have added 6 accounts. |

Use figures for 10 or above:

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| Please check back in 10 minutes. | Please check back in ten minutes. |
| You have $165 in your account. | You have one-hundred sixty-five dollars in your account. |

### Monetary figures
Always use numerals for money amounts less than $999.99: $0.05, $1.24, $165

For thousands, use numerals as well, but include a comma: $3,000. However, if space is a concern, a capital "K" after a numeral is just fine: $36K. Take care to round in a way that is most beneficial to the user in the specific context. 

For millions, billions, or trillions, use the word after the number or, if there are space constraints, a capital letter after the number: $1 million or $1M, $32 billion or $32B, $51 trillion or $51T.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| $145.67 | One hundred and forty-five dollars and sixty-seven cents |
| $2,987.67 | $2987.67 |
| $500 | $0.5K |
| $1.2M | $1,201,098.78 |

Plus or minus signs are needed in specific situations that depend on whether we're talking about an account balance, a transaction amount, or a gain/loss).

Asset account balances like checking accounts are typically positive, so no color or sign are needed for positive balances. When a balance is overdrawn, the figure should be red with a minus sign to alert the user that something unusual has happened.

Liability account balances like credit cards are typically negative, so no color or sign is needed for negative balances. In cases where the user overpaid or has a positive balance, the figure should be green with a plus sign to indicate that something unusual has happened.

Transactions are handled the same way in both asset and liability accounts. If money goes out of the account (a debit), figures do not need any color or sign. If money goes into the account (a credit) the figure should be green with a plus sign. 

Gains and losses — like in net worth — are different because there is no typical state, so we should always indicate it with color and sign. Losses should always be the standard color with a minus sign. Gains should always be green with a plus sign. 

|  | Balance | Transaction |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| Asset account | Positive: $2,437.87 (standard)<br/>Negative: - $349.54 (red) | Credit: + $34.67 (green) <br/>Debit: $65.87 (standard) |
| Liability account | Positive: + $505.83 (green)<br/>Negative: $295.38 (standard) | Credit: + $34.67 (green) <br/>Debit: $65.87 (standard) |

| Gain | Loss | 
| ---- | ------- |
| + $51.76 (green) | - $346.98 (standard) | 

## Dates and times
Capitalize the names of months in all uses. Wherever possible, use the full name of the month. Abbreviations in blocks of text should be the first three letters of the month followed by a period, e.g., Jan., Feb. Mar., etc. These may appear without the period in charts. 

Spell out when using alone, or with a year alone, wherever possible. 

In cases where space is extremely tight, a single-letter abbreviation may be used: J, F, M, etc. However, this should be avoided as it is non-standard and may confuse some users. Consider how space can be made for the clearer abbreviation.

Use numerals, without "st," "nd," "rd" or "th."

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| You will be charged in January 2021. | You will be charged in Jan. 2021. |
| You will be charged Jan. 6, 2021. | You will be charged January 6, 2021. |
| You will be charged Jan. 6. | You will be charged January 6. |

If you need to use a shortened version of a date, use backslashes to separate each number in the following format: MM/DD/YY. Use two digits each for the year, month, and day; use zeros in front of single-digit numbers. Do not put spaces before or after a backslash.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| 01/06/21 | 1/6/2021<br/>1/6/21<br/>1 / 6 / 21 |

When writing the time, use figures. Use a colon to separate hours from minutes, except on the hour, when no colon nor minutes are needed (i.e., don’t use double zeros). Use “a.m.” or “p.m.” (note the lowercase letters and periods), and put a space between the time and the a.m. or p.m. When giving a range of time, use an en dash, – , with a space on each side.

In cases of extreme space constraints, a single letter may be used to indicate a.m. or p.m.: 4a, 6p, etc. However, this should be avoided as it is non-standard and may confuse some users. Consider how space can be made for the clearer abbreviation. 

Time ranges that don't cross noon or midnight only need an a.m. or p.m. on the second time. If they do cross noon or midnight, include it on both. 

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| 12 a.m. | 12:00 a.m.<br/>12 AM<br/>12 am<br/>12am<br/>12a |
| 1 – 3:30 p.m.<br/>10 a.m. – 2:30 p.m. | 1:00 – 3:30 p.m.<br/>1 – 3:30 PM<br/>1 – 3:30 pm<br/>1 – 3:30pm<br/>1 – 3:30p<br/>1 - 3:30 p.m.<br/>1 p.m. – 3 p.m. |

When giving an amount of time, spell out the full words and use a comma between each segment, i.e., such as 10 hours, 15 minutes, 8 seconds. Use abbreviations only if you are tight on space: 10 hrs., 15 min., 8 sec.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| 10 hours, 15 minutes, 8 seconds | 10h, 15m, 8s<br/>10 hours 15 minutes 8 seconds |

When creating a countdown clock, use figures separated by a colon, i.e., 10:15:08. Do this only if the countdown will change every second, so as not to confuse it with the time, i.e., 10:15 a.m. or 10:15 p.m.

| Do | Don't | 
| ---- | ------- |
| 10:15:08 (for 10 hours, 15 minutes, 8 seconds)<br/>15:08 (for 15 minutes, 8 seconds) | 10h:15m:8s<br/>Don't use this for anything other than a countdown clock |

## Bold and italics
Be judicious and sparing with bold and italics. 

Both of these devices are meant to **emphasize** something and get the user's attention. However, when combined with multiple headings, buttons, modals, elements, etc., there can be a lot of things competing for the user's attention. We want to avoid that and make sure we're focusing users on what they really need in any given moment in a product. Think hard about what is really the most important information that needs emphasis. 

Keep in mind that italics can be difficult for some people to read in some fonts, especially if a long passage is italicized. So, avoid italicizing entire sentences or large blocks of text.

Similarly, bold text is often visually striking, but it may distract from other important things. Avoid bolding full sentences or large blocks of text. And avoid bolding words or short phrases too frequently, as this can sometimes seem like a jumble.
