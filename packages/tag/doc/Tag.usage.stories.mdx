# Tag

Use tags to label, categorize, or organize items using keywords that describe them.

## Overview
Tags can communicate the state or category of an object. For example if you are running an ad campaign you could use tags to show the state of the campaign (Pending, Running, Canceled, etc.).

Use short labels for easy scanning. Use two words only if necessary to describe the status and differentiate it from other tags.

## Tag types

| Type | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| Pending | Pending, loading, or disabled state |
| Success | Successful or healthy state |
| Warning | Degraded state |
| Error | Broken or down state |
| Primary | Active or running state |

## When to use
Use tags when content is mapped to multiple categories, and the user needs a way to differentiate between them.
