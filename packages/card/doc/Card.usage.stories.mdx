## Overview

Cards are containers that display content and actions on a single topic.

They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

Each card is made up of various content blocks (text, images, links, etc.). All of the blocks, as a whole, are related to a single subject or destination. Content can receive different levels of emphasis, depending on its level of hierarchy.

## Card customization

The following properties can be configured for cards:

- Border radius (4px or 8px)
- Padding (16px or 24px)
- Shadow or border stroke

## Card behavior

### Transform

Cards use a container transform transition pattern to reveal additional content.

### Gestures

Gestures should be implemented consistently within a card collection. Frequently used gestures on cards include swipe, pick up and move, and scrolling.

#### Swipe

A swipe gesture can be performed on a single card at a time, anywhere on that card.

It can be used to:
- Dismiss a card
- Change the state of a card (such as flagging or archiving it)

#### Pick up and move

The pick up and move gesture allows users to move and re-order cards in a collection. While cards are being moved the shadow should increase to shadow-high and the active card should always show on top of its siblings.
