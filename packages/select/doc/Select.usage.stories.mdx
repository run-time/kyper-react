## Overview
Select is a type of input that is used in forms, where a user is submitting data and chooses one option from a list.

### Select vs Dropdown
While the select and dropdown components look similar, they have different functions.

- Use the select component inside a form where users are selecting from a list of options and submitting data.
- Use the dropdown component to filter or sort content on a page.

Another important difference between the two components is the underlying code. The select componentâ€™s appearance will be determined by the browser being used, while the dropdown component can be styled.

## Order

The order of the select list should be based on the frequency of use. If applicable, the list should be in increasing order relative to the content. In cases of forms, alternative orders such as alphabetical may be more fitting. A horizontal rule can be used to group similar items together.
