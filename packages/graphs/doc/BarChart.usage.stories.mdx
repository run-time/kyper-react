Bar charts compare different values which are hierarchically equivalent. A stacked bar chart can be used to aggregate categorical data.

## Vertical Bar Chart

Bars are rounded on the top (according to the theme border radius) while the bar's baseline is left squared. Use whitespace between bars to adequately separate bars from each other, one rule of thumb is to provide spacing roughly half the width of the bars themselves. A Bar chart should always start with a baseline of zero.
