# Tabs

Use tabs to allow users to navigate easily between views within the same context.

## Formatting
<br/>

#### Tab label
Each tab label describes the content contained within it. Labels are concise and use no more than two words. Keep in mind that at mobile widths and during translation, the character length of a label will impact the experience. Do not use icons in tab labels.

#### Number of tabs
In most scenarios, you should use no more than six tabs. This maintains an uncluttered UI and reduces cognitive load for users. If more than six tabs are needed, consider other navigation patterns, such as a side-nav.

#### Order
Tab order should be consistent across an experience. Tabs with related content should be grouped adjacent to each other.

## Desktop vs mobile
Desktop tabs are left aligned. Tabs widths are determined by the label. On mobile tabs are full width. If there are two tabs each tab takes up 50% of the width. On mobile you should not use more than 3 tabs. Tabs should not scroll horizontally.
