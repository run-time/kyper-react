## Overview

Avatars are used to represent a user either via a profile picture or using the first letter of their first name. If a picture or name is not available fall back to the icon type. 

You can also use the avatar to show a business logo. Again, try to use the image type and use the other types when an image is not available.

## Avatar types

| Type | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| Image | The image variation is preferred in most cases. It allows the user to quickly identify the user or business they are looking for. |
| Text | Use the text variation when you don't have a profile image for a user. Typically you will get the user's first letter of the first name. For example, if the users name was Brian you would show a "B" on the avatar. |
| Icon | The icon variation is a fall back for when you don't have a profile picture or the first letter of the users first name. |
