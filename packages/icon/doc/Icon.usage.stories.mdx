# Icon

Icons are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects, or actions. They communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity, and draw attention to important information.

## Sizing

Components typically use icons on 16px artboards. Icons can also be used at 12px, 24px, and 32px. Be sure icon size is consistent throughout your product.

## Pairing with text

You should also center-align the icon with text. When icons are paired with text they should be the same color as the text they are paired with with a few exceptions. Exceptions include: 
- When using an icon to communicate status such as in a message box.
- When placing an icon on top of a background color. Often to meet contrast requirements the icon will need to be a different color than the text when placed on top of a background color.

| H2 & H3 | 24px |
| Body & Small | 16px |
| X-Small & Tiny | 12px |
