## Overview

Financial institutions are displayed widely across MX products. Whenever possible we should include the logo of the institution. This aids the user in sorting large lists of institutions and helps them find what they are looking for quickly.

You should never augment another company's a logo. This includes shifting the logo to grayscale or creating monochromatic version of the logo.
